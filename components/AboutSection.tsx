  Hi, I'm Prajyot Porje! I'm a passionate web developer currently pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at PES Modern College of Engineering. As a second-year student, Iâ€™m focused on honing my skills in coding and developing projects that bridge creativity and functionality. My technical toolkit includes a solid command of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which strengthens my problem-solving approach in web development. 
  <br />
  Beyond coding, I have a diverse set of interests that keep me balanced and motivated. Whether it's playing video games, hitting the gym, or playing cricket, I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle. Each of these pursuits fuels my creativity, determination, and teamwork skills, which I bring to my projects. Welcome to my portfolio
